## A preliminary study in best practices for effective data analysis and a step towards achieving Alberta Health’s annual strategic objectives

This project is divided into two phases of objectives that may be scaled further if required.
The purpose of this study is to present a preliminary framework of health data collection and storage for health partners under AHS’ ambit. 
The framework will aim to improve the precision, relevance, and organization of data points as a step towards greater data fluency.
